- latency points options
 - --latency 10,20,30,40

- option for metered sends (example, use 1000 req/sec for latency normalization)
 - -m --meter <req/sec>
 - if metered, don't send from poll
 - loop in start then loops through drops and sends until time is done
  - for (t = start; true; t += rate) { dsleep for t - now }
