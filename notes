- why do some not respond every once in a while?

- redo latency
 - use staggered collection
  - base 16
  - starting with 256 nsecs as an array of 256 values
  - next is 256 * 16 nsecs as an array of 256
  - up 16 second what ever a reasonable top end is
  - when a value arrives pick the correct stagger set then the slot in the set
   - each slot has an atomic int and is a counter of the occurances at that latency
 - calc mean as 50%
 - output value at each percent in 10% increments until 90% then 95 and 99
  - maybe allow marks to be specified
 - option graph (kind of fun)

- option for metered sends (example, use 1000 req/sec for latency normalization)
 - -m --meter <req/sec>
 - if metered, don't send from poll
 - loop in start then loops through drops and sends until time is done
  - for (t = start; true; t += rate) { dsleep for t - now }
